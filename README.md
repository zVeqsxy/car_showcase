# Car Showcase

This is a car showcase application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The application allows users to view details about different cars, filter them based on certain criteria, and possibly rent them (renting still in development).

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories:

- `app`: Contains the main layout and page of the application.
- `components`: Contains all the React components used in the application. This includes components for displaying car details, a search bar, a custom filter, and more.
- `constants`: Contains constant values used throughout the application.
- `types`: Contains TypeScript type definitions used in the application.
- `utils`: Contains utility functions used in the application.

## Features

- View details about different cars
- Filter cars based on certain criteria
- Search for cars by manufacturer and model
- View cars in a grid or list view
